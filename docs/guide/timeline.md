> **Note:** Dates marked with ~ are approximate — these concepts emerged organically from engineering practice rather than a single publication.

## What This Tells Us

1. **The fundamentals are OLD.** Semaphores (1965), heaps (1964), and state machines (1943) have been battle-tested for 60-80 years. When you use them, you're standing on decades of proven engineering.

2. **Most "new" patterns are compositions.** React's reconciler (2017) composes bitmask + min heap + cooperative scheduling + diff/patch + double buffering — all invented between 1943 and 1974.

3. **The gap between invention and widespread adoption is shrinking.** Bloom filters took 30 years from paper (1970) to widespread use in databases (2000s). Circuit breakers took only 5 years from book (2007) to Netflix Hystrix (2012).

4. **Patterns outlive the technologies that popularized them.** Copy-on-Write was invented for IBM mainframes in 1971 — it's now in Git, Rust, and every modern OS kernel.
