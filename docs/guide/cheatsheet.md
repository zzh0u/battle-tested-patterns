## Pattern Combos

Patterns rarely appear alone. These are the most common production combos:

| Combo | Used In | Why Together |
|---|---|---|
| WAL + Checkpointing | PostgreSQL, etcd | WAL for safety, checkpoint to bound replay |
| Bloom Filter + LSM Tree | LevelDB, RocksDB | Skip unnecessary disk reads |
| Min Heap + Merge Iterator | LevelDB compaction | Efficiently merge K sorted runs |
| Circuit Breaker + Retry | gRPC, Hystrix | Retry transient failures, break on persistent |
| Rate Limiter + Backpressure | API gateways | Limit ingress, signal overload |
| Ring Buffer + Event Loop | libuv, io_uring | Fixed-size queue for I/O events |
| Object Pool + Free List | Go runtime | Pool manages slabs, free list tracks slots |
| MVCC + B+ Tree | PostgreSQL | Versioned rows in disk-optimized index |
| Dirty Flag + Double Buffering | React Fiber | Mark dirty, batch into next frame |
| Bitmask + State Machine | React reconciler | Flags encode state, transitions via bitwise ops |
| Consistent Hashing + Registry | Service mesh | Hash to locate, registry to discover |
| Trie + Interning | Compilers | Intern strings, look up by prefix |
