# Complexity Cheat Sheet

Quick reference for time and space complexity of every pattern's key operations. Use this to compare trade-offs before choosing a pattern.

## How to Read This

- **n** = number of elements / items
- **k** = key length (for string-keyed structures)
- **m** = number of hash functions (Bloom filter)
- **L** = number of levels (skip list, LSM tree)
- Amortized costs marked with **(amort.)**

## Data Structures

|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| [Bitmask](/patterns/bitmask/) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Fixed-size; limited to word width (32/64 flags) |
| [Ring Buffer](/patterns/ring-buffer/) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | Fixed capacity; overwrites oldest on full |
| [Tagged Union](/patterns/tagged-union/) | — | O(1) | — | O(max variant) | Dispatch by tag; no dynamic allocation |
| [Min Heap](/patterns/min-heap/) | O(log n) | O(1) peek | O(log n) | O(n) | O(1) min access; used for priority queues |
| [Trie](/patterns/trie/) | O(k) | O(k) | O(k) | O(n × k) | Independent of total entries; prefix queries O(k + results) |
