# What is This?

**Battle-Tested Patterns** collects programming patterns that are:

1. **Production-proven** — used in top-tier projects like React, Linux kernel, Go runtime, and Chromium
2. **Interactive** — every pattern has a hands-on SVG visualization you can click, drag, and experiment with
3. **Cross-language** — idiomatic implementations in TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Python
4. **Code-level** — concrete techniques you can apply today, not abstract architecture concepts

## Why This Exists

There are plenty of "design patterns" books and "algorithms" repositories. But there's a gap:

| Existing Resources | What They Miss |
|---|---|
| Design Patterns (GoF) | Too abstract, too OOP-centric |
| Algorithm repositories | Disconnected from engineering practice |
| System Design guides | Architecture-level, not code-level |
| "Awesome" lists | Link collections, no teaching |
| Interactive tutorials | Usually one-off, not a systematic collection |

This project fills the gap: **code-level techniques extracted from production source code, with interactive visualizations and precise references you can verify yourself**.

## What Makes a Pattern "Battle-Tested"?

Every pattern in this collection must have:

- **≥ 2 production proofs** — precise GitHub links (to exact line numbers) showing the pattern in use
- **Multi-language implementations** — idiomatic code in TypeScript + at least one other language
- **Runnable exercises** — progressive difficulty levels with test suites

We never fabricate source links. If we can't find a verifiable reference, we don't include the pattern.

## Recommended Learning Paths

Pick a path based on your background — or just browse freely.

### Frontend Developer

Start with patterns you already use (possibly without realizing it):

1. [Diff / Patch](/patterns/diff-patch/) — React's virtual DOM reconciliation
2. [Bitmask](/patterns/bitmask/) — React fiber flags
3. [Cooperative Scheduling](/patterns/cooperative-scheduling/) — why React yields every 5ms
4. [Observer](/patterns/observer/) — Redux, EventEmitter
5. [Double Buffering](/patterns/double-buffering/) — React Fiber's `current` / `workInProgress`

Then see them compose: [Patterns from React](/by-project/react) · Quick reference: [Cheat Sheet](/guide/cheatsheet)

### Backend / Systems Developer

Start with patterns that appear in databases and distributed systems:

1. [Write-Ahead Log](/patterns/write-ahead-log/) — crash recovery in PostgreSQL, etcd
2. [MVCC](/patterns/mvcc/) — how readers never block writers
3. [Circuit Breaker](/patterns/circuit-breaker/) — fail fast in microservices
4. [Rate Limiter](/patterns/rate-limiter/) — token bucket for throughput control
5. [Consistent Hashing](/patterns/consistent-hashing/) — distribute keys across nodes

### Performance / Low-Level Engineer

Start with memory and concurrency patterns:

1. [Arena Allocator](/patterns/arena-allocator/) — bump allocate, free all at once
2. [Object Pool](/patterns/object-pool/) — avoid GC pressure
3. [Free List](/patterns/free-list/) — O(1) alloc/free
4. [Work Stealing](/patterns/work-stealing/) — Go runtime, Tokio scheduler
5. [Ring Buffer](/patterns/ring-buffer/) — lock-free queues

Then see how they compose: [Patterns from Go Runtime](/by-project/go-runtime) · [Patterns from Linux](/by-project/linux) · Quick reference: [Cheat Sheet](/guide/cheatsheet)

## How to Use This

- **Play with visualizations** — each pattern page has an interactive SVG visualization — click, drag, and build intuition
- **Browse patterns** — read the concept, study the production proof, then try the exercises
- **Run exercises locally** — `pnpm test:exercises` for TypeScript, `cargo test` for Rust, `go test` for Go
- **Try it online** — copy any code example into an official playground: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) · [Go](https://go.dev/play/) · [Rust](https://play.rust-lang.org/) · [Python](https://www.online-python.com/)
