# Patterns from Git

Git's data model is built on copy-on-write immutable objects and efficient diffing.

| Pattern | Where | What It Does |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| [Copy-on-Write](/patterns/copy-on-write/) | [`object-file.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/object-file.c#L719-L730) | Content-addressed immutable objects; branches share data, copy only on change |
| [Diff / Patch](/patterns/diff-patch/) | [`diff.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/diff.c#L5020-L5060), `xdiff/` | Myers' diff algorithm for minimal edit distance between file versions |
| [Bitmask](/patterns/bitmask/) | [`cache.h`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/cache.h) | `CE_*` cache entry flags — staged, valid, intent-to-add |
| [Bloom Filter](/patterns/bloom-filter/) | [`bloom.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/bloom.c) | Changed-path bloom filters for faster `git log -- <path>` |
| [Trie](/patterns/trie/) | [`read-cache.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/read-cache.c) | Name hash table for fast directory-level path lookup |
| [LRU Cache](/patterns/lru-cache/) | [`pack-objects.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/pack-objects.c) | Delta base cache for reusing computed deltas during pack |
| [Merkle Tree](/patterns/merkle-tree/) | [`tree.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/tree.c#L136-L171) | Content-addressed Merkle DAG — every commit, tree, blob is hashed; changing one byte changes all hashes up to root |

## How They Compose: `git commit`

When you run `git commit`, multiple patterns work together to create an immutable, verifiable snapshot:

```text
git commit -m "fix bug"
  │
  ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. DIFF / PATCH — Git computes the diff between   │
│    the index (staging area) and the working tree   │
│    to determine what changed.                      │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. COPY-ON-WRITE — changed files become new blob   │
│    objects. Unchanged files are shared by reference │
│    (same SHA-1 → same object). No data is copied   │
│    unless it actually changed.                     │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. MERKLE TREE — tree objects hash their children.  │
│    A changed blob changes its parent tree hash,    │
│    which changes the commit hash. Any tampering     │
│    anywhere is detectable from the root.           │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. BLOOM FILTER — the commit-graph file stores     │
│    changed-path bloom filters. Future `git log`    │
│    queries can skip commits that didn't touch a    │
│    given path without reading the tree.            │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  │

 New commit object (immutable, content-addressed)
```

The core insight is that copy-on-write + Merkle hashing gives Git both space efficiency (shared objects) and integrity verification (tamper-evident hashes) with no trade-off between the two.
