# Pattern: Dirty Flag

<DifficultyBadge />

## One Liner

Mark objects as "dirty" on mutation, defer expensive recomputation until the value is actually needed, then clear the flag.

<DemoBadge />

## Real-World Analogy

A "needs cleaning" sign on a hotel room door. Housekeeping only enters rooms marked dirty. If a guest hasn't been in the room, the sign stays clean, and housekeeping skips it — no wasted effort.

## Core Idea

The dirty flag pattern avoids redundant computation by tracking whether derived state is out of date. When a source value changes, instead of immediately recomputing all dependent values, we simply set a "dirty" flag. The expensive recomputation only happens when the derived value is actually requested. After recomputation, the flag is cleared. This trades a boolean check on every read for potentially expensive computations that may never be needed.

  Mutation cycle:

  ┌─────────┐   set()     ┌─────────────┐
  │  Clean  │ ──────────► │    Dirty    │
  │ (valid  │             │ (stale      │
  │  cache) │             │  cache)     │
  └─────────┘             └──────┬──────┘

       │         get()           │
       │    (recompute + clear)  │
       └─────────────────────────┘

  Timeline:

   dirty  dirty   dirty  recompute  dirty  recompute
                          (1 time)          (1 time)
                           ▲                  ▲
            3 mutations,   │   1 mutation,    │
            1 computation ─┘   1 computation ─┘
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Mutation cost | O(1) -- just set a boolean flag |
| Read cost (clean) | O(1) -- return cached value |
| Read cost (dirty) | O(recompute) -- compute + cache + clear flag |
| Space | O(1) per tracked value -- one boolean flag |

**Try it yourself** — move entities to mark them dirty, then recompute to see optimization savings:

## Production Proof

| Project | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chromium/Blink | [layout_object.h (NeedsLayout)](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/third_party/blink/renderer/core/layout/layout_object.h) | `NeedsLayout()` returns whether the layout object's geometry is dirty. When CSS properties change, `SetNeedsLayout()` marks the node and ancestors dirty. Layout computation only happens during the next layout pass -- not on every style change. This batches hundreds of DOM mutations into a single layout computation. |
| React | [ReactFiberFlags.js#L18-L22](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberFlags.js#L18-L22) | Fiber flags like `Placement`, `Update`, `Deletion` are dirty flags on fiber nodes. When state changes, fibers are marked with flags. The commit phase only processes fibers with non-zero flags, skipping unchanged subtrees entirely. |

## When to Use

- **UI layout engines** -- mark nodes dirty on style change, batch layout computation
- **Game scene graphs** -- dirty world transforms cascade from parent to children; recompute only when rendered
- **Spreadsheet cells** -- mark dependent cells dirty on input change, recompute on display
- **Build systems** -- mark targets dirty when source files change, rebuild only what's needed
- **Derived state caching** -- any computed property that's expensive and read less often than its inputs change

## When NOT to Use

- **Recomputation is cheap** -- if the computation takes nanoseconds, the flag check adds overhead for no benefit
- **Every mutation requires the result** -- if you always read after every write, you're just adding a flag check to every operation
- **Concurrency without synchronization** -- dirty flags are inherently mutable shared state; concurrent reads and writes need locks or atomics

## More Production Uses

- [Unity Engine](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference) -- `Transform.hasChanged` flag defers world matrix recomputation
- Qt Framework — `QWidget::update()` marks regions dirty; painting happens in the next event loop iteration
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) -- file modification times as dirty flags; only rebuild targets newer than sources
- [Excel/Google Sheets](https://support.google.com) -- cell dependency graph with dirty propagation; only recalculates changed subgraph

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: A scene graph has 1000 nodes. The root moves, making all descendants dirty. But only 3 nodes are actually rendered this frame. How many recomputations happen?
**Answer:** 3 recomputations (plus ancestors of each rendered node).

Setting 1000 nodes dirty costs O(1000) -- just flipping booleans. But recomputation only happens when `getWorldPosition()` is called on a node. Only the 3 rendered nodes trigger recomputation, and each walks up to the root to compute its chain. If the 3 nodes share ancestors, those ancestors are recomputed once and cached (flag cleared).

This is the key insight: dirty-flag cost is proportional to nodes **read**, not nodes **dirtied**.
:::

::: details Q2: React marks fiber nodes with flags like Placement|Update. Why use bitmask flags instead of a simple boolean dirty flag?
**Answer:** Multiple orthogonal kinds of "dirty."

A fiber node can need a placement (new DOM node), an update (changed props), a deletion, a ref update, or a layout effect -- all independently. A single boolean can only say "something changed." Bitmask flags encode **what** changed, so the commit phase can process each kind of work separately without re-examining the fiber.

This is a combination of the Dirty Flag pattern and the Bitmask pattern -- each bit is an independent dirty flag for a specific concern.
:::

::: details Q3: Your dirty-flag cache has a bug: `get()` returns stale data. The flag is set correctly. What's wrong?
**Answer:** The compute function captures stale closures or references.

Common causes:

1. The compute function closes over a variable that has since been reassigned (stale closure in React, for example).
2. The compute function reads from a cached/memoized source that is itself stale.
3. The dirty flag is cleared before the computation finishes (async compute).

Fix: ensure the compute function reads current values at call time, not captured values from registration time. In React, this is why `useMemo` takes a dependency array -- it creates a new compute function when dependencies change.
:::

::: details Q4: Your build system uses file modification timestamps as dirty flags. A developer checks out an old branch, which resets file timestamps to "now." The build system sees all files as "dirty" and triggers a full rebuild. How would you fix this?
**Answer:** Use content hashes instead of (or in addition to) timestamps as the dirty flag.

Timestamps are cheap to check but semantically fragile -- they track *when* a file changed, not *whether* it actually changed. Git checkout, file copy, CI artifact extraction, and clock skew all produce misleading timestamps. Content-based dirty flags (e.g., SHA-256 of the file) are immune to these problems: if the hash matches, the file hasn't changed, regardless of its timestamp. This is why Bazel and Buck use content hashing over timestamps. The tradeoff is that computing a hash is more expensive than `stat()`, but for build systems the cost of unnecessary recompilation far exceeds the cost of hashing.
