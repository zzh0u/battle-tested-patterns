# Pattern: Consistent Hashing

## One Liner

Distribute keys across nodes on a virtual ring so that adding or removing a node only remaps ~1/n of the keys.

<DemoBadge />

## Core Idea

Traditional modular hashing (`hash(key) % n`) remaps almost every key when `n` changes. Consistent hashing places both nodes and keys on a circular ring. Each key maps to the first node clockwise from its position. Adding or removing a node only affects keys in the arc between it and its predecessor.

```text
  Hash ring (0 to 2^32, wraps around):

  0         Node A    ●k1     Node B          ●k2     Node C    2^32→0
  ├───────────┼─────────┼───────┼───────────────┼───────┼─────────┤
              ▲         │       ▲               │       ▲         │
              │         │       │               │       │         │
              │         └───►───┘               └───►───┘         │
              │              ↑                       ↑            │
              │         k1→Node B              k2→Node C          │
              └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              k3 wraps around → Node A

  ●k1 = key "user:42"     → next node clockwise = Node B
  ●k2 = key "session:99"  → next node clockwise = Node C
  ●k3 = key "order:7" (between Node C and 2^32) → wraps → Node A
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Key remapping on add/remove | ~1/n (vs 100% with modular hash) |
| Virtual nodes (replicas) | Improve balance — each physical node maps to k positions on the ring |
| Lookup | O(log n) via binary search on sorted ring |

**Try it yourself** — add keys, then add/remove nodes to see minimal key redistribution:

## When to Use

- **Distributed caches** — route keys to cache servers, minimize cache invalidation on scale events
- **Load balancing** — distribute requests with minimal disruption when backends change
- **Sharded databases** — assign data partitions to nodes
- **CDNs** — route content to edge servers based on URL hash

## When NOT to Use

- **Static topology** — if nodes never change, modular hashing is simpler
- **Small clusters** — with < 5 nodes, random or round-robin may be good enough
- **Strict ordering** — consistent hashing doesn't preserve key ordering
- **Uniform distribution required** — without virtual nodes, distribution can be uneven

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: You have a hash ring with 3 physical nodes, each with 1 virtual node (no replicas). One node owns 60% of the key space while the others own 20% each. How do virtual nodes fix this, and why does groupcache default to a high replica count?
**Answer:** Virtual nodes spread each physical node across multiple positions on the ring, making the distribution converge toward uniform as the number of virtual nodes increases.

With only 1 position per node, the arc lengths between nodes are determined by hash values — essentially random, leading to high variance. With 100-200 virtual nodes per physical node, the law of large numbers kicks in and each physical node owns approximately 1/n of the ring. Groupcache defaults to a high replica count because statistical uniformity requires many samples. The tradeoff is memory: more virtual nodes means a larger sorted key array and ring map.
:::

::: details Q2: Node B crashes and is removed from a 5-node ring. Which node(s) absorb its traffic? Does every remaining node share the load equally?
**Answer:** Only the node immediately clockwise from B on the ring absorbs all of B's keys — the other three nodes are completely unaffected.

This is both the strength and weakness of consistent hashing. When B is removed, keys that mapped to B now "fall through" to the next clockwise node. Without virtual nodes, one node absorbs 100% of the redistributed load, potentially doubling its traffic. With virtual nodes, B's multiple ring positions are distributed, so its keys scatter across multiple successor nodes — closer to an even split. This is a key reason virtual nodes exist: they turn a "one neighbor absorbs all" failure into a "many neighbors share the load" failure.
:::

::: details Q3: Your cache cluster uses consistent hashing. A new product launch causes one specific key ("homepage_banner") to receive 100x the normal request rate. Consistent hashing maps it to Node C, which is now overloaded while other nodes are idle. Does consistent hashing solve hotspot problems?
**Answer:** No. Consistent hashing distributes keys evenly across nodes, but it cannot distribute load evenly when individual keys have vastly different request rates.

Consistent hashing solves the key *assignment* problem, not the key *popularity* problem. A single hot key always maps to one node. Solutions include: read replicas (cache the hot key on multiple nodes), request-level load balancing (route reads for hot keys randomly), or key splitting (split "homepage_banner" into "homepage_banner:1" through "homepage_banner:10" spread across nodes). The bounded-loads extension to consistent hashing addresses this by redirecting overflow traffic to the next node on the ring.
:::

::: details Q4: You need to migrate your cache cluster from 3 nodes to 5 nodes with zero downtime. During migration, both old and new nodes coexist. A key that remaps to a new node returns a cache miss even though the data exists on the old node. How do you handle this?
**Answer:** Use double-read during migration: look up the key on the new ring first, and on miss, fall back to the old ring.

Consistent hashing guarantees minimal remapping (~1/n keys move), but the keys that do move will miss on the new node until they're populated. The migration strategy is: (1) compute the key's owner on both the old and new rings, (2) read from the new node first, (3) on miss, read from the old node and backfill the new node. Once all keys are migrated (or the TTL expires naturally), remove the old ring. This is the approach used by systems like Memcached and Redis Cluster during resharding -- the consistent hash ring defines the target state, but a transition period handles the gap.
