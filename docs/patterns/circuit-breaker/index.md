# Pattern: Circuit Breaker

<DifficultyBadge />

## One Liner

Stop calling a failing service by tracking errors and tripping open — fail fast instead of piling up timeouts.

<DemoBadge />

## Real-World Analogy

An electrical fuse in your home. If too much current flows (repeated failures), the fuse blows and cuts the circuit immediately — protecting the wiring. After cooling down (timeout), you can reset it and try again.

## Core Idea

A circuit breaker wraps remote calls with a state machine that has three states. In the **closed** state, calls pass through normally. After a threshold of consecutive failures, the breaker **trips open** and all calls fail immediately without attempting the operation. After a cooldown period, the breaker enters the **half-open** state, allowing one probe call to test if the downstream service has recovered.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CLOSED
    CLOSED --> OPEN : failures >= threshold
    OPEN --> HALF_OPEN : timeout elapsed
    HALF_OPEN --> CLOSED : probe succeeds
    HALF_OPEN --> OPEN : probe fails
```

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| CLOSED | Calls pass through. Count consecutive failures. |
| OPEN | Calls fail immediately (`CircuitOpenError`). Timer running. |
| HALF_OPEN | Allow one probe call. Success → CLOSED. Failure → OPEN. |

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Call check | O(1) — compare state + failure counter |
| State transitions | O(1) — atomic state change |
| States | 3 — Closed, Open, Half-Open |
| Space | O(1) — counter + timer + state enum |

**Try it yourself** — send successes and failures to see the state machine transitions:

## Production Proof

| Project | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Netflix Hystrix | [HystrixCircuitBreaker.java#L138-L289](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/blob/master/hystrix-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixCircuitBreaker.java#L138-L289) | `HystrixCircuitBreakerImpl` — the canonical circuit breaker. Three-state enum (L142), `markSuccess`/`markNonSuccess` for HALF_OPEN transitions (L204-L224), `attemptExecution` for OPEN→HALF_OPEN via `compareAndSet` after sleep window (L264-L289). Used across Netflix's entire microservice fleet. |
| Sony gobreaker | [gobreaker.go#L117-L131](https://github.com/sony/gobreaker/blob/master/gobreaker.go#L117-L131) | `CircuitBreaker` struct with state, generation counter, counts, and mutex. `onSuccess`/`onFailure` (L310-L332) drive transitions; generation-based staleness detection (L334-L380) prevents acting on stale state reads. Production use at Sony. |

## When to Use

- **Microservice calls** — prevent cascading failures when a downstream service goes down
- **Database connections** — stop hammering a database that's overloaded
- **External APIs** — handle third-party service outages gracefully
- **Shared resources** — protect any shared resource that can become temporarily unavailable

## When NOT to Use

- **In-process calls** — circuit breakers add overhead; use error handling for local function calls
- **Idempotency not guaranteed** — if retries after half-open can cause duplicates, add deduplication first
- **Single-consumer systems** — if there's only one caller, backoff/retry is simpler than a full state machine
- **Fire-and-forget** — if you don't wait for a response, there's nothing to circuit-break

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: Your circuit breaker has a 30-second reset timeout. The downstream service has an average recovery time of 5 seconds. A colleague suggests lowering the timeout to 5 seconds so requests resume faster. What's the tradeoff?
**Answer:** A shorter timeout means you'll probe the service sooner, but if it hasn't recovered, each failed probe resets the timer and generates additional load on an already-struggling service.

The reset timeout is a tradeoff between recovery speed and protection. If you probe too early and fail, you reopen the circuit and wait another full timeout. Meanwhile, the failed probe adds load to the unhealthy service. A good timeout should be longer than the typical recovery time — 2-3x is common — to give the downstream service breathing room. Some implementations use exponential backoff on the timeout itself.
:::

::: details Q2: Service A calls Service B, which calls Service C. Service C goes down. Without circuit breakers, what happens to Service A even though it doesn't directly depend on C?
**Answer:** Service A's threads pile up waiting for Service B, which is itself blocked waiting for Service C — this is a cascading failure.

Each call from A to B occupies a thread (or connection) while B waits for C's timeout. As B's threads exhaust, B starts timing out too, causing A's threads to pile up. Soon A appears down to its own callers. This is exactly why Netflix built Hystrix: a circuit breaker on each service boundary would let B fail fast on C calls and return errors to A immediately, keeping A's threads free. Without it, one downstream failure can topple an entire call chain.
:::

::: details Q3: Your circuit breaker enters HALF_OPEN and allows one probe request. But in a high-traffic system, 200 concurrent requests arrive in the same millisecond. All 200 see the state as HALF_OPEN and send probe requests simultaneously. How would you prevent this thundering herd?
**Answer:** Use an atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) to transition from OPEN to HALF_OPEN, ensuring only one request becomes the probe while all others fail fast.

Netflix Hystrix solves this with `compareAndSet` on the state flag — exactly one thread wins the CAS and sends the probe. Sony's gobreaker uses a mutex with a generation counter for similar single-probe guarantees. The key insight is that HALF_OPEN is not a state you "read" passively — the transition to it should be an atomic operation that grants probe rights to exactly one caller.
:::

::: details Q4: Your team uses a circuit breaker for database calls. A developer notices the breaker trips open during a routine database migration that causes 5 seconds of elevated latency but zero actual errors. Should the circuit breaker be tracking latency, not just errors?
**Answer:** Yes, but carefully. Latency-based tripping protects callers from slow responses, but you need distinct thresholds for "slow" vs "failed" to avoid false trips during normal variance.

A request that takes 10 seconds and eventually succeeds still ties up a thread for 10 seconds. In a thread-pool model, slow responses are functionally equivalent to failures because they exhaust capacity. Hystrix tracked both errors and timeouts as failures. The nuance is choosing the latency threshold: set it too low and normal P99 variance trips the breaker; set it too high and it provides no protection.
