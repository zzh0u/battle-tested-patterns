# Pattern: Reference Counting

<DifficultyBadge />

## One Liner

Track owners via atomic counter, auto-cleanup at zero -- deterministic resource lifetime without garbage collection.

<DemoBadge />

## Real-World Analogy

A shared Netflix account. You keep track of how many people are actively using it. When the last person cancels, the subscription is terminated. No background check needed — the count reaching zero is the signal.

## Core Idea

Reference counting assigns each shared resource a counter. Every new owner (clone) increments it; every release (drop) decrements it. When the counter reaches zero, the resource is immediately cleaned up -- no GC pause, no finalizer queue, fully deterministic.

```text
  ┌────────────┐
  │  Resource  │   refcount = 1
  │  (value)   │
  └─────┬──────┘
        │
     owner A

  A.clone() → B
  ┌────────────┐
  │  Resource  │   refcount = 2
  │  (value)   │
  └──┬─────┬───┘
     │     │
  owner A  owner B

  A.drop()
  ┌────────────┐
  │  Resource  │   refcount = 1
  │  (value)   │
  └─────┬──────┘
        │
     owner B

  B.drop()
  ┌────────────┐
  │  Resource  │   refcount = 0 → cleanup()!
  │  (value)   │
  └────────────┘
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Clone | O(1) -- increment counter |
| Drop | O(1) -- decrement counter, conditionally cleanup |
| Cleanup trigger | Deterministic -- exactly when last owner drops |
| Thread safety | Requires atomic operations (or mutex) for multi-threaded use |

**Try it yourself** — drop references to decrement ref counts and watch objects get freed at rc=0:

## Production Proof

| Project | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| CPython | [refcount.h#L255-L310](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Include/refcount.h#L255-L310) | `Py_INCREF` (L255-L310) is the inline function that increments `ob_refcnt`. `Py_DECREF` (L417-L430) decrements and calls `_Py_Dealloc` at zero. Every Python object carries `ob_refcnt` in `PyObject` ([object.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Include/object.h)). This is the primary memory management mechanism -- GC only exists to break reference cycles. |
| Rust std | [sync.rs#L269-L276](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/alloc/src/sync.rs#L269-L276) | `Arc<T>` (Atomic Reference Counted) struct at L269. `Drop` impl (L2799-L2875) calls `fetch_sub(1, Release)` on strong count, Acquire fence, then `drop_slow()` at zero. Used pervasively across Tokio, Actix, and OS-level Rust code. |

## When to Use

- **Shared ownership with deterministic cleanup** -- multiple parts of code need the same resource, and you need it freed the moment the last user is done (file handles, GPU buffers, database connections)
- **Avoiding GC pauses** -- real-time systems (games, audio) where stop-the-world GC is unacceptable
- **Interop between languages** -- CPython's refcount lets C extensions manage Python objects naturally; COM uses `AddRef`/`Release` across DLL boundaries
- **Short-lived shared state** -- when objects are mostly owned by one place but occasionally shared briefly (Rust's `Rc`/`Arc` pattern)

## When NOT to Use

- **Cyclic data structures** -- parent-child cycles (e.g., doubly linked lists, graph nodes) leak because the count never reaches zero. Use weak references or a tracing GC.
- **High-contention sharing** -- if many threads constantly clone/drop the same object, the atomic counter becomes a cache-line bottleneck. Consider epoch-based reclamation or hazard pointers.
- **Bulk allocation patterns** -- if you allocate/free thousands of small objects, per-object counters add overhead. Use arena allocation instead.

## More Production Uses

- [Swift ARC](https://github.com/apple/swift) -- Swift's entire memory model is built on automatic reference counting (compiler-inserted retain/release)
- [COM IUnknown](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) -- `AddRef`/`Release` across every COM object in Windows
- [Linux kernel kobject](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/lib/kobject.c) -- `kref` provides reference counting for kernel objects
- [Objective-C ARC](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html) -- compiler-managed `retain`/`release` calls

| [Copy-on-Write (CoW)](/patterns/copy-on-write/) | Reference counting determines when a CoW value needs to be copied |

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: Object A references B, and B references A. Both have refcount 2. You drop your handle to A. What happens?
**Answer:** Memory leak. Dropping your handle to A decrements A's refcount to 1 (B still references A). A's refcount never reaches 0, so A is never freed. Since A is never freed, it never drops its reference to B, so B's refcount stays at 1 forever.

This is the **reference cycle problem** -- the fundamental weakness of reference counting. Solutions: (1) use weak references for back-pointers (Rust's `Weak<T>`, Python's `weakref`), (2) add a cycle-detecting GC on top (CPython does this), (3) redesign to avoid cycles entirely.
:::

::: details Q2: CPython uses refcounting as its primary GC strategy, yet it still has a cycle collector. Why not just use refcounting alone?
**Answer:** Reference counting alone cannot reclaim reference cycles. Any data structure with mutual references (parent-child, graph edges, closures capturing `self`) would leak.

CPython's cycle collector (`gc` module) periodically walks objects that *could* form cycles (containers like lists, dicts, objects with `__dict__`) and identifies unreachable groups. The refcount handles the ~95% of objects that don't participate in cycles, making the cycle collector's job lighter. This hybrid approach gives deterministic cleanup for most objects while still handling cycles.
:::

::: details Q3: Rust's `Arc` uses `fetch_add(1, Relaxed)` for Clone but `fetch_sub(1, Release)` for Drop. Why different memory orderings?
**Answer:** Clone only needs to ensure the counter is incremented -- no data is accessed or freed, so `Relaxed` (cheapest ordering) suffices. The counter just needs to go up atomically.

Drop is different: before freeing the resource, all previous writes by all threads must be visible. `Release` on the decrement ensures that the thread doing the final cleanup (which uses an `Acquire` fence) sees all data written by every thread that ever held a reference. Without this, the destructor might read stale data.

This is a classic performance optimization -- `Relaxed` is essentially free on x86, while `Release` involves a store barrier.
:::

::: details Q4: You're building a resource pool. Should you use reference counting or a finalizer/destructor?
**Answer:** Neither alone is ideal for pools. Reference counting triggers cleanup at zero, but "cleanup" for a pooled resource should mean "return to pool," not "destroy."

The correct pattern is: wrap the pool item in a ref-counted handle where the "cleanup" callback returns the item to the pool instead of freeing it. This is exactly how database connection pools work -- `Drop` on the handle returns the connection rather than closing it. The pool itself manages actual destruction (e.g., on shutdown or when connections are stale).
