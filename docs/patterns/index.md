# All Patterns

46 production-proven patterns organized by category. Each one has interactive visualization, multi-language implementations, exercises, and precise source links.

## Data Structures

| Pattern | One-Liner | Sources |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [Bitmask](./bitmask/) | Pack N flags into one integer, O(1) test any combo | React, Linux |
| [Min Heap](./min-heap/) | O(1) peek at highest priority, O(log n) push/pop | React, Linux CFS |
| [Ring Buffer](./ring-buffer/) | Fixed-size FIFO, wraps around, zero allocation | LMAX, Linux |
| [Trie](./trie/) | O(k) prefix lookup, shared prefixes share nodes | Linux FIB, Redis |
| [Skip List](./skip-list/) | Probabilistic O(log n) sorted structure | Redis, LevelDB |
| [Bloom Filter](./bloom-filter/) | Probabilistic set membership, zero false negatives | LevelDB, Chromium |
| [LRU Cache](./lru-cache/) | Evict least recently used, O(1) get/put | groupcache, Linux |
| [B+ Tree](./b-plus-tree/) | High-branching tree, leaf-linked for range scans | PostgreSQL, SQLite |
| [Tagged Union](./tagged-union/) | Type tag + union for safe multi-type dispatch | Godot, PyTorch |
| [Merkle Tree](./merkle-tree/) | Hash upward for O(log n) integrity proof | Git, ZFS |
| [Merge Iterator](./merge-iterator/) | K-way merge via min-heap | LevelDB, RocksDB |

## Concurrency

| [Work Stealing](./work-stealing/) | Idle threads steal from busy queues | Go, Tokio |
| [MVCC](./mvcc/) | Versioned rows let readers never block writers | PostgreSQL, etcd |
| [Cooperative Scheduling](./cooperative-scheduling/) | Yield between work chunks to stay responsive | React, Go |
