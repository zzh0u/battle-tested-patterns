# Pattern: MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

<DifficultyBadge />

## One Liner

Keep multiple timestamped versions of each value so readers never block writers — each transaction sees a consistent snapshot without locks.

<DemoBadge />

## Real-World Analogy

A library that keeps old editions of books alongside new ones. Readers who checked out edition 3 can finish reading it even after edition 4 is published. Each reader sees a consistent snapshot — no one sees a half-written update.

## Core Idea

MVCC stores every write as a new version tagged with a timestamp or transaction ID. Readers see the latest version visible to their snapshot, ignoring concurrent writes. This eliminates read-write contention: readers never block writers, writers never block readers.

```text
  Key "balance"
  ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
  │ t=100    │ t=200    │ t=300    │ t=400    │
  │ val=500  │ val=450  │ val=600  │ val=580  │
  └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘

  Transaction at t=250:  sees val=450  (latest version ≤ 250)
  Transaction at t=350:  sees val=600  (latest version ≤ 350)
  Both read without blocking the writer at t=400.
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Read-write conflict | **None** — readers see their snapshot, writers append new versions |
| Write-write conflict | Detected at commit time (first-writer-wins or abort) |
| Space overhead | Multiple versions per key (garbage collected via compaction) |
| Isolation level | Snapshot isolation (stronger than read-committed, weaker than serializable) |

**Try it yourself** — start transactions, read and write keys, and observe snapshot isolation:

## Production Proof

| Project | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | [heapam_visibility.c#L917-L1096](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/e18b0cb7344cb4bd28468f6c0aeeb9b9241d30aa/src/backend/access/heap/heapam_visibility.c#L917-L1096) | `HeapTupleSatisfiesMVCC` — the core visibility check. Given a heap tuple and an MVCC snapshot, determines if the tuple is visible to the current transaction. Uses `XidInMVCCSnapshot` to check transaction visibility without contention on `ProcArrayLock`. |
| etcd | [kvstore.go#L53-L135](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/e9b62f804766edf77cfa918d600cb6fb2c56b401/server/storage/mvcc/kvstore.go#L53-L135) | `store` struct (L53-L82) tracks `currentRev` and `compactMainRev` with a B-tree `kvindex` for multi-version lookups. `NewStore` (L87-L135) initializes the MVCC store and rebuilds the in-memory index from persisted revisions. Powers Kubernetes' configuration backbone. |

  private store = new Map<string, Version<T>[]>();

  put(key: string, value: T, timestamp: number): void {
    if (!this.store.has(key)) this.store.set(key, []);
    this.store.get(key)!.push({ timestamp, value, deleted: false });
  }

  get(key: string, timestamp: number): T | undefined {
    const versions = this.store.get(key);
    if (!versions) return undefined;

## When to Use

- **Databases** — snapshot isolation for concurrent transactions (PostgreSQL, MySQL InnoDB)
- **Distributed KV stores** — consistent reads without distributed locks (etcd, CockroachDB, TiKV)
- **Time-travel queries** — read data as of a past timestamp
- **Optimistic concurrency** — detect conflicts at commit time instead of locking upfront

## When NOT to Use

- **Single-writer systems** — MVCC overhead is unnecessary if only one writer exists
- **Memory-constrained** — multiple versions per key consume significant storage
- **Write-heavy, no reads** — version management overhead with no reader benefit
- **Strict serializability needed** — MVCC provides snapshot isolation; full serializability requires additional mechanisms (SSI)

## More Production Uses

- [MySQL InnoDB](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) — undo logs for MVCC row versioning
- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) — Percolator-based distributed MVCC transactions
- [FoundationDB](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb) — multi-version storage layer

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: Your MVCC store keeps every version of every key forever. After a year of operation, storage usage is 50x the actual live dataset size. How do production databases like PostgreSQL handle this?
**Answer:** They run garbage collection (called "vacuuming" in PostgreSQL) to remove versions that are no longer visible to any active transaction.

PostgreSQL's `VACUUM` process identifies "dead" tuples — versions older than the oldest active transaction's snapshot. Since no transaction can ever see these versions, they're safe to reclaim. etcd uses `compaction` to discard revisions older than a threshold. The challenge is determining the "low-water mark": the oldest snapshot still in use. If a long-running transaction holds an old snapshot, it blocks garbage collection for all versions newer than that snapshot — a common source of PostgreSQL bloat.
:::

::: details Q2: Two transactions both read key "balance" (value=100) at the same snapshot timestamp, then both try to write "balance=90" (deducting 10). Under MVCC snapshot isolation, both reads succeed without blocking. What happens at commit time?
**Answer:** One transaction commits successfully; the other detects a write-write conflict and aborts. The balance ends up at 90, not 80.

This is the "lost update" anomaly under snapshot isolation. Both transactions read the same snapshot (balance=100) and independently compute balance=90. MVCC detects the conflict at commit time using a "first-writer-wins" rule: the first to commit writes version t=200 with value=90. The second transaction tries to commit but sees that "balance" was modified after its snapshot — it must abort and retry. On retry, it reads the new value (90) and writes 80. This is why MVCC provides snapshot isolation, not serializable: it prevents lost updates but requires application-level handling of write conflicts.
:::

::: details Q3: Your team uses MVCC with snapshot isolation for a banking system. A compliance audit asks: "Can two concurrent transfers between the same accounts produce an inconsistent total?" Your team says snapshot isolation prevents this. Are they correct?
**Answer:** No. Snapshot isolation prevents lost updates but is vulnerable to write skew anomalies, where two transactions read overlapping data and make non-conflicting writes that together violate a constraint.

Example: accounts A=50 and B=50 with a constraint "A+B >= 0." Transaction 1 reads both, sees total=100, writes A=-10. Transaction 2 reads both (same snapshot, A=50, B=50), writes B=-60. Both pass the constraint check independently, both commit (they write different keys, so no write-write conflict), and the result is A=-10, B=-60, total=-70 — violating the constraint. Full serializability (PostgreSQL's SSI, CockroachDB's serializable mode) is needed to prevent write skew.
:::

::: details Q4: etcd uses MVCC to power Kubernetes' configuration store. Why does a distributed key-value store benefit from keeping old versions, rather than just storing the latest value?
**Answer:** Old versions enable watch/subscribe semantics — clients can ask "what changed since revision X?" without polling, and disconnected clients can catch up from their last-seen revision.

Kubernetes controllers (like the replication controller) use etcd watches to react to state changes. If etcd only stored the latest value, a controller that disconnects for 5 seconds would miss intermediate changes and need a full resync. With MVCC, the controller reconnects and says "give me all changes since revision 12345," receiving a precise stream of what changed. This is also essential for etcd's consistency guarantees: linearizable reads can be served from a specific revision, and time-travel queries enable debugging ("what was the cluster state 10 minutes ago?").
