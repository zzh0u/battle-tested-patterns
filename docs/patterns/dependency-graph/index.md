# Pattern: Dependency Graph

## One Liner

Model dependencies as a directed acyclic graph and topologically sort to determine a valid execution order — detecting cycles before they deadlock.

## Core Idea

A dependency graph represents items as nodes and ordering constraints as directed edges. `addEdge(A, B)` means "A must come before B" — A is a prerequisite of B. Topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) repeatedly removes zero-in-degree nodes, producing an ordering where every prerequisite appears before its dependents.

```text
  addEdge(wash, dry)     wash ──► dry ──► fold
  addEdge(dry, fold)          0        1       2
  addEdge(wash, fold)         │                ▲
                              └────────────────┘

  In-degree:  wash=0   dry=1   fold=2
  Output:     wash  →  dry  →  fold
  (zero in-degree first, then dependents)

  Cycle:  a → b → c → a  ← ERROR: no valid order
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Add node/edge | O(1) |
| Topological sort | O(V + E) — visit each node and edge once |
| Cycle detection | Built into topological sort (remaining nodes = cycle) |
| Space | O(V + E) — adjacency list |

**Try it yourself** — add nodes and edges, then run topological sort to watch Kahn's algorithm step through:

## Production Proof

| Project | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Cargo (Rust) | [dep_cache.rs#L1-L50](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/core/resolver/dep_cache.rs#L1-L50) | `RegistryQueryer` manages the dependency resolution graph for Rust packages. Dependencies form a DAG resolved via backtracking, with the `resolve` function producing a topological ordering of crate versions for compilation. |
| pnpm | [graph-sequencer#L22-L125](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/main/deps/graph-sequencer/src/index.ts#L22-L125) | `graphSequencer` — topologically sorts workspace packages by their inter-dependencies with cycle detection. Used by `pnpm -r` recursive commands to respect dependency ordering across a monorepo. |

## Exercises

| Level | Exercise | File |
|-------|----------|------|
| Basic | Implement topological sort with cycle detection | `exercises/typescript/dependency-graph/01-basic.test.ts` |
| Intermediate | Parallel execution planner — compute execution waves | `exercises/typescript/dependency-graph/02-intermediate.test.ts` |

Run exercises: `pnpm test`

## When to Use

- **Build systems** — compile dependencies before dependents (Make, Bazel, Cargo)
- **Package managers** — install/build order for workspace packages (pnpm, npm, yarn)
- **Task scheduling** — job orchestration with prerequisites (Airflow, CI/CD pipelines)
- **Module bundlers** — determine chunk splitting and loading order (webpack, Rollup)
- **Database migrations** — apply schema changes in dependency order

## When NOT to Use

- **Circular dependencies exist by design** — use a different model (e.g., event-driven, lazy evaluation)
- **No ordering needed** — if tasks are independent, a simple list suffices
- **Dynamic dependencies** — if edges change at runtime, incremental approaches are better
- **Very large graphs** — consider parallel algorithms (Kahn's is inherently sequential without modifications)

## More Production Uses

- [Make (GNU)](https://github.com/mirror/make) — prerequisite DAG determines target rebuild order
- [Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) — action graph with topological execution phases
- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) — `ModuleGraph` for chunk splitting and tree shaking
- [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) — resource dependency graph for parallel apply

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: Given a dependency graph where A->C, B->C, and A and B have no dependencies, how many tasks can run in parallel? How does topological sort reveal this?
**Answer:** A and B can run in parallel (both have in-degree 0). C must wait for both. Maximum parallelism is 2.

Topological sort using Kahn's algorithm naturally exposes parallelism: all nodes with in-degree 0 at any given step can execute simultaneously. In this example, the first "wave" is {A, B} (both in-degree 0), and the second wave is {C} (in-degree drops to 0 after both A and B complete). Build systems like Bazel and Make exploit this by processing each wave in parallel.
:::

::: details Q2: Package D depends on both B and C. B depends on A. C also depends on A. This is a "diamond dependency." Does topological sort handle it correctly?
**Answer:** Yes. Topological sort handles diamonds correctly because it tracks in-degree, not paths. A runs first, then B and C (in parallel), then D.

A diamond is not a cycle -- it's just two paths converging on the same node. Kahn's algorithm processes A (in-degree 0), decrements B and C's in-degrees to 0, processes both, then decrements D's in-degree to 0 and processes it. The potential problem is not in ordering but in version conflicts: if B needs A v1 and C needs A v2, you have a compatibility issue that the graph structure alone doesn't solve.
:::

::: details Q3: You change file `utils.ts` in a large project. An incremental build system only recompiles files that depend on `utils.ts`. How does the dependency graph enable this?
**Answer:** The build system walks the dependency graph forward from `utils.ts`, collecting all transitive dependents. Only those files (plus `utils.ts` itself) need recompilation.

This is the key advantage of maintaining a dependency graph over a flat file list. Without the graph, you'd have to recompile everything or maintain manual lists of dependencies. With the graph, you compute the affected subgraph in O(V+E) time. Tools like webpack's `ModuleGraph` and Bazel's action graph do exactly this -- they track which outputs depend on which inputs and invalidate only the affected subtree.
:::

::: details Q4: A developer adds a dependency from module A to module B, but B already transitively depends on A (B -> C -> A). What should the build system do?
**Answer:** Reject the change. Adding A -> B creates a cycle (A -> B -> C -> A), which means there is no valid build order.

Kahn's algorithm detects this: after processing all zero-in-degree nodes, some nodes remain with non-zero in-degree -- those nodes form the cycle. The build system should report the exact cycle path so the developer can redesign the dependency (e.g., extract shared code into a new module, use dependency inversion, or use lazy/dynamic imports to break the compile-time cycle).
