# Pattern: Event Loop / Reactor

## One Liner

A single-threaded loop that multiplexes I/O via epoll/kqueue, dispatching ready events to callbacks -- thousands of connections without threads.

<DemoBadge />

## Core Idea

Instead of dedicating one thread per connection (expensive context switches, high memory), the reactor pattern uses a single thread that blocks on an OS polling mechanism (`epoll`, `kqueue`, `IOCP`). When any registered file descriptor becomes ready, the loop dispatches to the associated callback. This is how Node.js handles 10,000+ concurrent connections on a single thread.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Concurrency model | Single-threaded, non-blocking I/O |
| Connections | Thousands per thread (limited by file descriptors, not threads) |
| Latency | Low for I/O-bound work; one slow callback blocks everything |
| Memory | O(connections) for state, not O(connections * stack_size) |

**Try it yourself** — add tasks to the call stack and queues, then step through the event loop execution order:

## Production Proof

| Project | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| libuv | [core.c#L427-L492](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/src/unix/core.c#L427-L492) | `uv_run` (L427-L492) is the main event loop function used by Node.js. Processes timers, pending callbacks, polls for I/O (`uv__io_poll`), runs check handles, and closes handles in a single `while` loop. Supports three run modes: `UV_RUN_DEFAULT` (run until no more active handles), `UV_RUN_ONCE`, `UV_RUN_NOWAIT`. |
| Redis | [ae.c#L360-L468](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/ae.c#L360-L468) | `aeProcessEvents` (L360-L468) is Redis's event loop core. Calculates the nearest timer, calls `aeApiPoll` (epoll/kqueue/select abstraction) with that timeout, then dispatches file events and timer events. Redis achieves 100K+ ops/sec on a single thread because the event loop never blocks on individual operations. |

type Handler = () => void;

class EventLoop {
  private handlers = new Map<number, Handler>();

  /** Register a handler for a file descriptor. */

    this.handlers.set(fd, callback);
  }

  /** Remove a handler for a file descriptor. */
  removeHandler(fd: number): void {
    this.handlers.delete(fd);
  }

  /** Execute one tick: call all registered handlers once. */
  tick(): number {
    const count = this.handlers.size;
    for (const [, handler] of this.handlers) {
      handler();
    }
    return count;
  }

  /** Run the event loop for up to maxTicks. Stops early if no handlers. */
  run(maxTicks: number): number {
    let ticksRun = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < maxTicks; i++) {
      if (this.handlers.size === 0) break;
      this.tick();

## When to Use

- **High-connection servers** -- web servers, chat servers, API gateways where thousands of connections are mostly idle (waiting for I/O)
- **I/O-bound workloads** -- network proxies, load balancers, database connection pools where CPU work per request is minimal
- **Real-time communication** -- WebSocket servers, game servers, notification systems where low latency per-message matters more than throughput
- **Embedded/resource-constrained** -- when you can't afford the memory overhead of one thread per connection (each thread = 1-8 MB stack)

## When NOT to Use

- **CPU-bound work** -- a single-threaded event loop blocks on computation. If you need to hash passwords, resize images, or run ML inference, use thread pools or worker processes alongside the event loop.
- **Simple request-response** -- if you have < 100 concurrent connections and each request is straightforward, threads-per-request is simpler and debuggable. The event loop adds complexity (callback management, state machines) without benefit.
- **Strict ordering requirements** -- when events must be processed in exact arrival order with no interleaving, a simple sequential loop or queue consumer is clearer.

## More Production Uses

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) -- libuv-based event loop powering the entire Node.js runtime
- [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx) -- worker processes each run an event loop with epoll/kqueue
- [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) -- Rust async runtime built on mio (cross-platform reactor)
- [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty) -- Java NIO event loop for high-performance networking

## Challenge Questions

::: details Q1: Your Node.js server handles 5,000 WebSocket connections fine, but adding a single endpoint that computes a Fibonacci number blocks ALL connections. Why?
**Answer:** The event loop is single-threaded. While computing Fibonacci (CPU-bound, synchronous), the event loop cannot process any I/O events. All 5,000 WebSocket connections are frozen until the computation completes.

Solutions: (1) offload CPU work to a `worker_threads` pool, (2) break computation into chunks with `setImmediate()` to yield back to the event loop between chunks, (3) use a separate microservice for heavy computation. This is the fundamental tradeoff of the event loop model -- cooperative multitasking means one bad actor blocks everyone.
:::

::: details Q2: Redis is single-threaded and uses an event loop, yet it handles 100K+ operations per second. How?
**Answer:** Redis operations are extremely fast -- most are O(1) hash table lookups or O(log N) sorted set operations that take microseconds. The event loop overhead is negligible compared to network I/O time.

The bottleneck is not CPU but network: reading/writing to sockets, parsing the protocol, and serializing responses. Since Redis uses non-blocking I/O via `aeProcessEvents`, it processes one command per event (read → parse → execute → write) and immediately moves to the next ready socket. There's no context switching, no lock contention, and the entire dataset fits in memory -- pure sequential throughput.
:::

::: details Q3: libuv's `uv_run` has three modes: DEFAULT, ONCE, NOWAIT. When would you use each?
**Answer:**

- **DEFAULT**: Normal operation -- run until all handles/requests are done. This is what `node app.js` uses. The process stays alive until there are no more timers, servers, or pending callbacks.
- **ONCE**: Process one round of events, then return. Useful for embedding libuv in another event loop (e.g., a game engine's main loop that also needs to handle Node.js events).
- **NOWAIT**: Like ONCE but never blocks on I/O poll. Only processes already-ready events. Useful for polling in a tight loop where blocking would cause missed frames or deadlines.

The key difference: DEFAULT blocks indefinitely, ONCE blocks for one iteration, NOWAIT never blocks.
:::

::: details Q4: Why does Nginx use multiple worker processes each with its own event loop, rather than one single event loop?
**Answer:** One event loop on one CPU core wastes the other cores. Nginx spawns N worker processes (typically one per CPU core), each running its own independent event loop.

This gives you: (1) multi-core utilization without shared-state threading bugs, (2) process isolation -- one crashed worker doesn't take down others, (3) zero-downtime reload -- new workers start with new config while old workers drain. The `SO_REUSEPORT` socket option lets all workers accept connections on the same port, with the kernel load-balancing across them.
