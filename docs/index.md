## Patterns

| Pattern | Key Insight | Source Projects |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| [Bitmask](/patterns/bitmask/) | Pack multiple flags into a single integer | React, Linux, Chromium |
| [Double Buffering](/patterns/double-buffering/) | Swap between two copies for atomic updates | React Fiber, GPU, PostgreSQL |
| [Cooperative Scheduling](/patterns/cooperative-scheduling/) | Voluntarily yield control to stay responsive | React, Go Runtime |
| [Min Heap](/patterns/min-heap/) | O(1) access to the highest-priority item | React Scheduler, Linux CFS, Node.js |
| [Diff / Patch](/patterns/diff-patch/) | Compute minimal changes between two states | React Reconciler, Git |
| [Object Pool](/patterns/object-pool/) | Pre-allocate and reuse objects to avoid GC | Go sync.Pool, Godot Engine |
| [Ring Buffer](/patterns/ring-buffer/) | Fixed-size circular queue, zero allocation | LMAX Disruptor, Linux ftrace |
| [State Machine](/patterns/state-machine/) | Explicit states + transitions, impossible states unrepresentable | XState, Linux TCP |
| [Copy-on-Write](/patterns/copy-on-write/) | Share by reference, copy only on mutation | Git objects, Rust Cow |
| [Observer / Pub-Sub](/patterns/observer/) | Subscribe to events, get notified without coupling | Node EventEmitter, Redux |

| [Batch Processing](/patterns/batch-processing/) | Accumulate ops, execute as a group for throughput | Kafka RecordAccumulator, React batched setState |
| [Retry with Backoff](/patterns/retry-backoff/) | Retry with exponential delay + jitter | Kubernetes, gRPC |
| [Flyweight / Interning](/patterns/flyweight/) | Share identical objects, avoid duplicate allocations | Python int cache, V8 |
| [Bloom Filter](/patterns/bloom-filter/) | Probabilistic set membership — zero false negatives | LevelDB, Chromium Blink |
| [Circuit Breaker](/patterns/circuit-breaker/) | Stop calling failing services, fail fast | Netflix Hystrix, Sony gobreaker |
| [Arena Allocator](/patterns/arena-allocator/) | Bump-allocate in a region, free all at once | Rust bumpalo, jemalloc |
| [Backpressure](/patterns/backpressure/) | Slow producers when consumers can't keep up | Node.js Streams, Reactive Streams |
| [Write-Ahead Log](/patterns/write-ahead-log/) | Log mutations before applying for crash recovery | etcd, PostgreSQL |
