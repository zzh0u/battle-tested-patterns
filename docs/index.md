    title: Production Proof
    details: Every pattern comes with precise GitHub source links (down to line numbers) proving it's used in real-world projects.
  - icon: 🌍
    title: Multi-Language
    details: Idiomatic implementations in TypeScript, Rust, Go, and C — not mechanical translations, but native expressions of each pattern.
  - icon: 🧪
    title: Runnable Exercises
    details: Progressive exercises (basic → intermediate → advanced) with test suites you can run locally.
  - icon: 🧠
    title: Challenge Questions
    details: Each pattern includes 3-4 scenario-based "guess what happens" questions to test real understanding, not just reading.
  - icon: 🔀
    title: Real System Case Studies
    details: See how React, Redis, Go runtime, Linux, PostgreSQL, and Kafka compose multiple patterns in production.
