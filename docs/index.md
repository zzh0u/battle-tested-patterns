## Patterns

| Pattern | Key Insight | Source Projects |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| [Bitmask](/patterns/bitmask/) | Pack multiple flags into a single integer | React, Linux, Chromium |
| [Double Buffering](/patterns/double-buffering/) | Swap between two copies for atomic updates | React Fiber, GPU, PostgreSQL |
| [Cooperative Scheduling](/patterns/cooperative-scheduling/) | Voluntarily yield control to stay responsive | React, Go Runtime |
| [Min Heap](/patterns/min-heap/) | O(1) access to the highest-priority item | React Scheduler, Linux CFS, Node.js |
| [Diff / Patch](/patterns/diff-patch/) | Compute minimal changes between two states | React Reconciler, Git |
| [Object Pool](/patterns/object-pool/) | Pre-allocate and reuse objects to avoid GC | Go sync.Pool, Godot Engine |
| [Ring Buffer](/patterns/ring-buffer/) | Fixed-size circular queue, zero allocation | LMAX Disruptor, Linux ftrace |
| [State Machine](/patterns/state-machine/) | Explicit states + transitions, impossible states unrepresentable | XState, Linux TCP |
